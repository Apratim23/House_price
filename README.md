# House Price Prediction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model that predicts house prices.

**1. Introduction**

House price prediction is a challenging and important task in real estate. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as:

* **Square footage**
* **Number of bedrooms**
* **Number of bathrooms**
* **Location**
* **Age of the property**
* **Proximity to amenities**

**2. Data**

* **Source:** [Specify the source of the dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository]
* **Description:** [Briefly describe the dataset, including the number of samples, features, and any relevant information]
* **Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    * Handling missing values (imputation, removal)
    * Feature scaling (standardization, normalization)
    * Encoding categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding)
    * Feature engineering (creating new features)

**3. Methodology**

* **Model Selection:**
    * [List the models considered, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks]
    * [Explain the rationale for choosing the selected model(s)]
* **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * [Describe the training and validation process, including techniques like cross-validation]
    * [Metrics used for evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared]
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    * [Techniques used for hyperparameter tuning, e.g., Grid Search, Random Search]

**4. Results**

* [Present the performance of the best-performing model(s)]
* [Include visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate the results]
* [Discuss the model's strengths and weaknesses]

**5. Conclusion**

* [Summarize the findings and key takeaways]
* [Discuss potential areas for future improvement]

**6. Usage**

* **Installation:**
    * [List the required libraries, e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib]
    * [Provide instructions for installing dependencies, e.g., using pip]
* **Running the Code:**
    * [Provide instructions on how to run the prediction script]
    * [Describe how to input new data for prediction]
